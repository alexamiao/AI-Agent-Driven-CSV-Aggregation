# AI-Agent-Driven-CSV-Aggregation
This project implements a CSV concatenation workflow and evaluates how an AI agent selects and invokes callable functions based on prompt design and function structure.

## Overview
The project focuses on designing simple data-processing utilities and evaluating agent behavior when interacting with tools. Two CSV concatenation approaches are implemented to compare how agents handle parameterized versus simplified function signatures, providing insight into reliability and execution behavior.

## Key Features
- CSV file aggregation using Python and Pandas  
- Multiple function interfaces to evaluate agent execution behavior  
- Agent-driven function invocation using natural language prompts  
- Emphasis on prompt clarity and API design
